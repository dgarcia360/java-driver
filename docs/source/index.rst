Datastax Java Driver for Apache CassandraÂ®
==========================================

A modern, `feature-rich`_ and highly tunable Java client library for
Apache Cassandra (2.1+) and using exclusively Cassandra's binary
protocol and Cassandra Query Language v3. Use the `DataStax Enterprise
Java driver <http://docs.datastax.com/en/developer/java-driver-dse/latest>`_ for better compatibility and support for
DataStax Enterprise.

**Features:**

-  `Sync`_ and `Async`_ API
-  `Simple`_, `Prepared`_, and `Batch`_ statements
-  Asynchronous IO, parallel execution, request pipelining
-  `Connection pooling`_
-  Auto node discovery
-  Automatic reconnection
-  Configurable `load balancing`_ and `retry policies`_
-  Works with any cluster size
-  `Query builder`_
-  `Object mapper`_

The driver architecture is based on layers. At the bottom lies the
driver core. This core handles everything related to the connections to
a Cassandra cluster (for example, connection pool, discovering new
nodes, etc.) and exposes a simple, relatively low-level API on top of
which higher level layers can be built.

The driver contains the following modules:

-  driver-core: the core layer.
-  driver-mapping: the object mapper.
-  driver-extras: optional features for the Java driver.
-  driver-examples: example applications using the other modules which
   are only meant for demonstration purposes.
-  driver-tests: tests for the java-driver.
